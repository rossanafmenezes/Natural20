This is my first attempt at a Kotlin app. It's an ongoing project, I'm still at the beginning of the Kotlin course and still a bit lost coming from Java. It's supposed to be an RPG dice roller. You have the main activity with an image button for each different type of dice and when clicked will take you via intent to each respective activity. Once there you should be able to select the number of dice you want to roll and the roll button will sum up all the random numbers together and return a total.
