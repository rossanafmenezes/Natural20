This is my first attempt of a kotlin app. It's an ongoing project, I'm still in the beginning of the Kotlin course and still a bit lost coming from Java. 
It's supposed to be a RPG dice roller. You have a main activity with an image button for each different type of dice and when clicked will take you via intent to 
each respective activity. Once there you should be able to select the number of dice you want to roll and the roll button will sum up all the random numbers 
together and return a total.
